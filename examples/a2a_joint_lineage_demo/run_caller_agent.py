"""Run the caller-side supervisor against every campaign brief.

For each campaign:

  1. Spin one ADK session on ``InMemoryRunner`` with the caller BQ AA
     Plugin attached.
  2. Stream the brief through; the supervisor commits four local
     decisions, then delegates audience-risk review to the receiver
     via ``RemoteA2aAgent`` — that delegation produces an
     ``A2A_INTERACTION`` row in the caller's ``agent_events``.
     **ADK 1.33 caveat:** ``RemoteA2aAgent`` spawns its own
     InvocationContext with a fresh caller-side ``session_id``, so
     the ``A2A_INTERACTION`` row lands under that sub-session
     (``agent='audience_risk_reviewer'``), NOT under the supervisor
     session. The mapping projection below pairs them back together.
  3. Record ``campaign_runs`` (supervisor session_id ↔ campaign
     mapping) so the auditor projection can resolve campaign
     metadata.
  4. Materialize ``supervisor_a2a_invocations`` — a deterministic
     pairing of each supervisor's ``TOOL_STARTING`` for
     ``audience_risk_reviewer`` with the corresponding
     ``A2A_INTERACTION`` row on the RemoteA2aAgent sub-session, via
     chronological rank within the same (app_name, user_id). This is
     the bridge ``build_joint_graph.py``'s ``remote_agent_invocations``
     uses to keep the ``CallerCampaignRun -> RemoteAgentInvocation``
     edge valid under ADK 1.33's split-session telemetry shape.

After all sessions finish, runs four acceptance gates:

  G1. caller dataset has ≥ N ``A2A_INTERACTION`` rows where
      ``agent='audience_risk_reviewer'`` (N == campaign count);
  G1.5. ``supervisor_a2a_invocations`` row count == campaign count
        and every row has a non-NULL ``a2a_context_id``;
  G2. receiver dataset has ≥1 row;
  G3. ≥1 mapped ``a2a_context_id`` matches a receiver ``session_id``.

G2 and G3 poll with backoff because the receiver-side
``BigQueryAgentAnalyticsPlugin`` writes asynchronously. The caller
flush completes before this script returns, but receiver-side rows
can lag. Hard-fails fast if any gate fails — partial demos are
worse than no demo.

# Supervisor ↔ RemoteA2aAgent-sub-session mapping projection.
#
# Under ADK 1.33, ``RemoteA2aAgent`` spawns its own InvocationContext
# with a fresh caller-side session_id. The ``A2A_INTERACTION`` row
# therefore lives in a sibling session (``agent='audience_risk_reviewer'``)
# with no foreign key back to the supervisor session that triggered
# the delegation. The two events DO share ``user_id`` and live in the
# same caller dataset, so chronological-rank pairing within the
# current run's session set deterministically reconstructs the link:
#
#   * Supervisor side: ``TOOL_STARTING`` rows scoped to
#     ``session_id IN UNNEST(@sessions)`` with
#     ``content.tool = 'audience_risk_reviewer'`` and
#     ``content.tool_origin = 'A2A'``. Filters out non-current
#     supervisor sessions and the four local tool calls per brief.
#   * A2A side: ``A2A_INTERACTION`` rows with
#     ``agent = 'audience_risk_reviewer'`` and
#     ``timestamp >= MIN(supervisor_ts)`` — the timestamp lower bound
#     keeps stale rows from prior runs out without needing a
#     supervisor-session FK on the A2A row.
#
# Pairing by ``ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY timestamp)`` is correct
# because campaign briefs run sequentially (each ``_run_one`` awaits
# completion before the next starts), so the chronological order is
# strict: TS₁ < A2A₁ < TS₂ < A2A₂ < TS₃ < A2A₃.
