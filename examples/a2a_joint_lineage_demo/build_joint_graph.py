"""Materialize the auditor's joint context graph.

Reads the caller and receiver SDK-extracted graph backing tables
(populated by ``build_org_graphs.py``) and creates redacted
projection tables in ``<AUDITOR_DATASET>``, then issues the
``joint_property_graph.gql`` rendered by ``render_queries.sh``.

All projections use ``CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE ... AS SELECT ...`` so
re-runs are idempotent. This avoids the streaming-buffer / duplicate
key class of failure the decision-lineage demo hit in PR #99.

Auditor projections (Phase 1):

  - ``caller_campaign_runs`` — projection of caller demo metadata,
    renames ``session_id`` -> ``caller_session_id`` to match the
    graph DDL's ``KEY (caller_session_id)``.
  - ``remote_agent_invocations`` — one row per caller-side
    ``A2A_INTERACTION``. Carries lineage IDs only (``a2a_task_id``,
    ``a2a_context_id``, optional ``receiver_session_id_from_response``);
    drops raw ``a2a_request`` / ``a2a_response`` / ``content``.
  - ``receiver_runs`` — receiver-side session roots derived from
    ``GROUP BY session_id`` over the receiver ``agent_events``.
  - ``receiver_planning_decisions`` — projection of receiver
    ``decision_points``.
  - ``receiver_decision_options`` — projection of receiver
    ``candidates`` (carries ``rejection_rationale`` as a property,
    NULL for SELECTED options, non-NULL for DROPPED).
  - ``joint_a2a_edges`` — stitch table joining
    ``remote_agent_invocations.a2a_context_id`` to
    ``receiver_runs.receiver_session_id``.

Redaction is a *convention* enforced by these projection tables,
not an IAM-enforced control. In a single-project demo, anyone with
project-level access can SELECT * from the underlying caller and
receiver datasets directly. Production cross-org redaction
enforcement is a separate working group.

  Four checks:

  1. Stitch coverage — every row in ``remote_agent_invocations``
     must have a matching row in ``joint_a2a_edges``. A "≥1 row
     traversal" check would silently pass on a partially broken
     auditor graph (3 remote calls, 1 stitched edge, downstream
     traversal returns the one stitched campaign and looks fine).
     This gate fails if any remote call is unstitched, with a
     pointer at Block 1 in ``bq_studio_queries.gql`` for diagnosis.
  2. Aggregate receiver-extraction coverage — scoped
     ``receiver_planning_decisions`` and ``receiver_decision_options``
     must meet the same thresholds ``build_org_graphs.py`` uses
     (defaults 3 / 9). Catches no-reset reruns where the unscoped
     receiver dataset satisfies the per-org gate but the scope
     chain dropped most rows.
  3. Per-receiver-session coverage — every stitched receiver
     session must have ≥1 decision and ≥3 candidates (the per-call
     receiver-prompt contract). Catches the case where (2) passes
     because some sessions over-produce while others have zero,
     leaving Block 4 empty for one specific campaign even though
     the aggregate count is fine.
  4. End-to-end traversal — walks all the way to
     ``ReceiverDecisionOption`` so a broken scope chain or a
     KEY/REFERENCES drift in the property graph DDL produces zero
     rows even when (1)-(3) pass.
